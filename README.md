### <h2>I'm Amol, a product designer and builder from Michigan!</h2>  
  
I'm an international student from India studying Computer Science @ University of Michigan. Recently, I've been exploring web3 and building some exciting projects on-chain - the innovation happening in this space is incredible!

When I'm not hacking away at smart contracts or diving into blockchain tech, you'll probably find me brainstorming startup ideas or lost in music. Always eager to connect with fellow builders and tech enthusiasts :)

Let's chat!
